hidex-python
============

A python module that apadts the HIDEX high dimensional explorer.  Hidex is a  a family word
co-occurrence model built by cyrus.  You can find his work here: https://github.com/cyrus/high-dimensional-explorer/

This module places the files in the directory structure necisary for HIDEX to funciton, then runs Popen commands to execute hidex.  

This adaptor uses a modified version of HIDEX that can be found here. This modifies the output directory structure so it is easier to capture in python.  No processing changes have been made.
